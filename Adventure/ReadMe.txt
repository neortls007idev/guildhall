Deep Learning
	
 With Adventure Prototype assignment I learned that albeit Data driving is powerful, it can be very dangerous too. As a programmer we now need to be ready to consider the bugs a normal person can create when changing that data. It may seem a tedious job to setup at first but once the initial groundwork for data driven gameplay is setup it can prove to we very valuable and can increase the development speed. The biggest issue with data driven is debugging cause now other than your code an invalid data might cause issues that you never even thought about in the first place.

Another thing I learned was that at times certain things may seem really complex when you first read or hear about them but once you start your attempts and as you make progress you realize how simple they were in the first place.
